# Setup Instructions

1. run npm install
2. put a .env file in the root directory, the Clerk API key variable as: VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and set it equal to your api key (ask me if you need an API key, should be easy to get from Clerk website)
3. run npm run dev, make sure the backend is running also (see backend repo for instructions on how to run backend)
4. Go to the localhost link provided in the terminal
5. Have fun! Sign in first and use the app!

If for some reason you do not have npm or homebrew or both installed. Then follow this first. 

- Copy and paste this into terminal: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" and hit enter

- enter your password and once it finishes downloading, it will give you some additional instructions for setting up homebrew. 

- once homebrew is installed, run brew install node

- now you can follow the setup instructions starting from run npm install
