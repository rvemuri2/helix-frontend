# Setup Instructions

1. run npm install
2. put a .env file in the root directory, the Clerk API key variable as: VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and set it equal to your api key (ask me if you need an API key, should be easy to get from Clerk website)
3. run npm run dev, make sure the backend is running also (see backend repo for instructions on how to run backend)
4. Go to the localhost link provided in the terminal
5. Have fun! Sign in first and use the app!
